# YZU_Maker

The main.py script serves as the central control program for the Smart Food Container. It integrates the hardware components, processes sensor data, and provides an interface for managing the container's features.

## Key Functionalities
### Sensor Integration:

- Reads data from sensors (e.g., weight, temperature, or humidity) connected to the Raspberry Pi.
- Monitors food conditions in real-time.

### Data Processing:

- Converts raw sensor inputs into actionable insights (e.g., food spoilage predictions or weight-based alerts).
### Notifications:

#### Sends alerts or reminders for:
- Expiring food items.
- Restocking needs based on weight thresholds.
### User Interaction:

- Offers a command-line or GUI interface (if applicable) to display data and interact with the system.
